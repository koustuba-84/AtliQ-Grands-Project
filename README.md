# AtliQ Grands Project on Hospitality domain

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on the hospitality domain, specifically for AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels in India. The project aims to provide insights into the hotel's performance, occupancy rates, revenue analysis, and more.

## Project Overview

**AtliQ Grands** owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. This project aims to leverage business and data intelligence to help AtliQ Grands regain market share and revenue.

## Objectives

- Analyze occupancy rates and identify trends.
- Provide detailed revenue analysis.
- Evaluate booking platforms' performance.
- Identify key metrics for each property.

## Data Sources

The data for this project was gathered from various Excel sheets, including:

- Bookings data
- Revenue data

## Data Cleaning and Modeling

The data was cleaned and pre-processed to ensure accuracy and consistency. A star schema was used for data modeling to optimize the performance of Power BI reports.
